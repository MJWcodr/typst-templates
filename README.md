## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

I use custom templates for Typst in many of my projects. This repository is a collection of those templates.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Clone the repository and copy the templates to your Typst templates directory.
Then add:

```
#import "path/to/template" : template

#with template (
    <args>
)
```

For further info see the Template folders.
